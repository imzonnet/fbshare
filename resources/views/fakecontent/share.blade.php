            <p class="story-body__introduction">EDF has confirmed that its finance director has quit ahead of an
                expected final investment decision on the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. </p>
            <p>Thomas Piquemal stepped down because he feared the project could jeopardise EDF's financial
                position, according to reports.</p>
            <p>EDF shares are trading 6.6% lower. </p>
            <p>Last month, Chris Bakken, the director of the project that could produce 7% of UK electricity by
                2025, said he was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-35482001"
                                     class="story-body__link">leaving to pursue other opportunities</a>.</p>
            <p>Jean-Bernard Levy, chairman and chief executive of EDF, said Mr Piquemal told him of the decision
                to leave last week and that he regretted the "haste" of Mr Piquemal's departure.</p>
            <p>The company's board is expected to finalise in April how it will fund the project after
                postponing the decision a number of times.</p>
            <p>Mr Levy said the board was studying the investment in Hinkley Point to ascertain the best way to
                finance the power plant. He added that EDF aimed to announce a final investment decision
                "soon".</p>
            <p>EDF has provisionally appointed Xavier Girre, who joined the company last year as finance
                director of its French business, as the group finance chief.</p>
            <hr class="story-body__line">
            <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Economics Editor</h2>
            <p>At first take, it might appear the resignation of a company's finance director reveals a business
                in crisis.</p>
            <p>And EDF's share price fall this morning seems to bear that out.</p>
            <p>But, for supporters of the building of a new £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in
                Somerset - the world's most expensive power project - the resignation of Thomas Piquemal looks
                like clearing the way for the EDF board to give the final go-ahead for the scheme.</p>
            <p>Mr Piquemal was widely reported as being a trenchant critic of the costly nuclear project.</p>
            <p>His fate appears to have been sealed last week when the French government, which largely owns
                EDF, confirmed that it is still backing the scheme</p>
            <p>That came after the meeting between Francois Hollande and David Cameron - also an enthusiastic
                backer.</p>
            <p>On this occasion, political will has trumped any financial concerns. </p>

            <p>The project has been plagued by delays, but publicly the firm has insisted a decision to move
                forward is imminent. </p>

            <p>But according to reports, EDF is struggling to find the cash for its remaining 66.5% stake and is
                seeking help from the French government, which owns 84.5% of EDF.</p>

            <p>The company is also facing opposition from French union officials, who have suggested that
                investment in Hinkley Point C should be delayed until 2019.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-35689784" class="story-body__link">CFE-CGC
                    Energy union said</a> there were problems with a similar reactor design in France that
                needed to be solved.</p>
            <p>Francois Raillot from the union which has a seat on EDF's board, said the company could sell some
                assets to finance Hinkley Point, but added: "It is a very bad time to do it because the price of
                energy is so low.</p>
            <p>"The state, which is a shareholder, will have to give [EDF] money to do it. But another problem
                is that the French state has no money."</p>
            <p>The new Hinkley plant was originally due to open in 2017, and it has come under fire for both its
                cost and delays to the timetable for building.</p>
            <p>The British government has also been criticised for <a
                        href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22772441" class="story-body__link">guaranteeing
                    a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour of electricity</a> - more than twice the current cost -
                for the electricity Hinkley produces for 35 years.</p>
            <p>A UK Government spokesperson said: "We continue to fully support the project and President
                Hollande said himself on Thursday afternoon that it has the full support of the French
                Government." </p>
            <h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Financing issues</h2>
            <p>Tony Roulstone, from the Cambridge Nuclear Energy Centre, said the departure of Mr Piquemal was
                "a big blow".</p>
            <p>He said EDF was already facing a number of other financing issues, including a decision to buy a
                majority stake in Areva's nuclear reactor unit, adding: "They are committed to upgrading their
                existing power stations in France at a cost of €55bn over 15 years."</p>
            <p>"At a commercial level there is a way for the government to step aside but at a political level,
                this is part of the energy strategy," he said.</p>
            <p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: "What I think is
                vitally important is we get a decision on Hinkley, and then we get on with replacing our
                generation stock which is going off line.</p>
            <p>"We need new nuclear as part of that low carbon balance linked to the future. And Hinkley is an
                important part of that."</p>
            <p>Tom Burke, chairman of environmental think tank E3G, said there was now "a serious question mark"
                over the future of Hinkley Point.</p>
            <p>"You've now had two senior people leave within a month, both clearly having trouble convincing
                their colleagues to go ahead in the direction that their colleagues want to go."</p>
